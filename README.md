There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react).

Check it out: [React single-page application calling Express.js web API using OAuth 2.0 on-behalf-of flow](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial/tree/main/6-AdvancedScenarios/1-call-api-obo)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-spa-dotnetcore-webapi-obo/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
